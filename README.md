# prigit
A CLI tool for interacting with your home Git server, based on `gh` and made in Nim.
Or at least, that's what it hopefully *will* be. Right now it doesn't work.


Right now, I have no plans to make this "production ready," so don't expect many, if any, safety features or error checking.
I'm making this primary for myself, and it'll change with my needs.
That being said, if you'd like to use this yourself, feel free to make any changes you'd like.
